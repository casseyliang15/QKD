This is a sample desktop application where we use python to create a very simple GUI to calculate key rate. The python will call MATLAB Engine API to run the key rate calculation. 

Software used in this:
1. Python 3.10.10
2. tkinter 8.6
3. MATLAB Engine API (https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html)
4. MATLAB 2023

**NOTE**

**This is just a very small part of the whole code. The whole code (data acquistion, optimization, post-processing, etc) are confidential.** 
**However, I can show you the live demo of key rate calculation during interview.**
